# KARATAKA GAME

## DESCRIPTION
KaratakA is a 2D farming simulation game where the player takes on the role of a farmer whose goal is to efficiently develop and manage a virtual farm using a renewable energy source

## TECHNOLOGY
Renpy : evenf if it's designed for creating visual novels or life simulation games, we found it fun to build KARATAKA on that game engine 'cause it's just a narrative-driven game
